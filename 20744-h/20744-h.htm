<p>The subject of this narrative was born
in Norfolk, Virginia, in 1823. Her maiden
name was Mary Smith Kelsey. Her mother
was a free colored woman, very light,
and her father a white man&mdash;an Englishman
of rank and culture. She was a
very lovely child in person and manners,
and as she grew up, developed traits of
character which made her a universal favorite.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
When she was six years old, her mother
sent her to Alexandria, for the purpose of
attending school. She remained there in
school about ten years, residing with her
aunt, Mary Paine. Mrs. Paine occupied a
house belonging to Mr. Rollins Fowle, and
near his residence. This gentleman and
his family were distinguished for their
kindness to colored people. He frequently
bought slaves who were in danger of being
sold into bad hands, gave them their freedom,
and set them up in business. John
Paine, Mary's uncle, was one whom he
freed in this way. Mary was a great pet
in Mr. Fowle's family, and was treated
almost like a daughter.</p>

<p>A schoolmate of hers, now residing in
Providence, Rhode Island, says Mary was
a very amiable girl, and a good student.
They for a time attended a select colored
school taught by a colored woman. Afterward
they attended a colored school<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
taught by white teachers. The last teacher
was Mr. Nuthall, an Englishman. He
taught till a law of Congress enacted that
the law of Virginia in relation to free colored
people should prevail in the District
of Columbia. This was several years before
Alexandria was retroceded to Virginia.
This law closed all colored schools
in the city. Mary was compelled to leave
the school in consequence of being informed
of as having come from Virginia.</p>

<p>While at school, Mary acquired a good
English education, and, in addition to this,
a knowledge of various kinds of needlework,
and also dress-making. Her aunt
was a devoted Christian, and no doubt had
a very happy influence on Mary. Her
mother also was converted when Mary was
two or three years old. Under these influences
she was early the subject of serious
impressions. Though fond of general
reading and study, there was no book she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
loved so well as the Bible. This was her
companion and text book, and she committed
large portions of it to memory.</p>

<p>When sixteen years old, having finished
her education, she returned to her mother,
at Norfolk. Soon afterward, those religious
elements which had existed from
early childhood&mdash;grown with her growth
and strengthened with her strength&mdash;became
dominant by the grace of God, and
asserted their power over her.</p>

<p>Near her residence was a garden, connected
with a large old mansion, between
Fenchurch and Church Streets. In this
garden was a dilapidated family tomb. It
was impressed on her mind that she must
go into this tomb to pray. At the dead
hour of night she sought this gloomy
abode of moldering coffins and scattered
bones. As she entered and knelt in the
death cell, she trembled with a fear which
her prayers could not dissipate. Quickly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
and stealthily she retraced her steps, and
hurried back to her home. Yet the next
night, this girl of sixteen had the courage
to seek the dismal place again, and the
next night yet again, with similar results.
But at length light broke upon the darkness
of the tomb, and it became a place
of delightful communion with her Lord;
whence it was afterward called "Mary's
parlor." At the midnight hour, she left
the tomb, and broke the silence of the
night with a jubilant song, fearless of the
patrol. The song was this strain of Watts,
in which many a saint has poured forth
his soul:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Stand up, my soul, shake off thy fears,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And gird the gospel armor on;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">March to the gates of endless joy,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Where Jesus, thy great Captain, 's gone.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Hell and thy sins resist thy course,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But hell and sin are vanquished foes;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy Jesus nailed them to the cross,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And sung the triumph when he rose.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
<span class="i0">"Then let my soul march boldly on,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Press forward to the heavenly gate;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There peace and joy eternal reign,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And glittering robes for conquerors wait.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"There shall I wear a starry crown,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And triumph in almighty grace;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While all the armies of the skies<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Join in my glorious Leader's praise."<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>This strain fell on the waking ears of
ladies in the house adjacent to the tomb,
and they inquired, "What sweet music is
that? Who is serenading at this hour?"
Little did they know the spirit-promptings
of that song.</p>

<p>Soon after this, Mary went to visit some
friends in Hampton. As she entered the
yard, and approached the house, she sang
another expressive hymn of Watts:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Firm as the earth thy gospel stands,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">My Lord, my Hope, my Trust;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If I am found in Jesus' hands,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">My soul can ne'er be lost.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
<span class="i0">"His honor is engaged to save<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The meanest of his sheep;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All whom his heavenly Father gave<br /></span>
<span class="i1">His hands securely keep.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Nor death nor hell shall e'er remove<br /></span>
<span class="i1">His favorites from his breast;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Safe on the bosom of his love<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Shall they for ever rest."<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Her friends opened the door at the
sound of the tender music, and as they
looked on her face, and listened to her
song, they were overcome, and could not
restrain their emotions.</p>

<p>Soon afterward, she united with the
First Baptist Church in Norfolk, on Bute
Street. The pastor was Rev. James A.
Mitchell, who served the church from the
time of Nat Turner's insurrection till his
death, about 1852. He was emphatically
a good man, and a father to the colored
people&mdash;a very Barnabas, "son of consolation"
indeed. A considerable portion of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
his church were colored people, and he
would visit them at their houses, take meals
with them, and enter into their affairs, temporal
and spiritual, with a true and zealous
heart. He never loved slavery; his private
opinion was against it, but he was
obliged to be cautious in the expression of
his sentiments. He endured great trials
for this proscribed class, and was almost a
martyr in their behalf, his pastorate having
begun just after Nat Turner's insurrection,
which caused great persecution and restriction
of privileges. But the Lord was
with him, and made him to triumph.</p>

<p>Mary's mother says that she delighted to
visit the poor in Norfolk, and especially the
aged. A very old man, in the suburbs,
often came to her door, and never went
empty away; and frequently at evening
she would go and carry him warm tea, and
in the winter she brought him wood in
small armfuls. When he died, he said he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
wanted Mary to have all that belonged to
him. Though he was scarcely worth three
cents, it was a rich heart gift.</p>

<p>Her Christian course was marked with
usefulness. Self-denying devotion to the
glory of God and the good of others characterized
her earlier, as her later career.
A deacon of the church on whom the writer
called when recently in Norfolk, says
she had a strong desire for the conversion
of souls, and was often found exhorting
them to repentance. Other members of
the church bore the highest testimony to
her uniform Christian deportment.</p>

<p>In 1847, Mary's mother was married to
Thompson Walker, and bought a house in
Hampton, where they resided until the
town was burned by the rebels in 1861.
Though sustaining herself by her needle,
Mary found time for many labors of love.
Among other things, she originated a benevolent
society, called the "Daughters of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
Zion," designed for ministration to the
poor and the sick. It is still in existence.</p>

<p>Her house, like that of Mary and Martha
of old, was a place of spiritual resort.
There the pastor, deacons, and other leading
members of the church found congenial
society. She early began the exercise
of her gifts as a teacher. At that
time, fifteen years ago, she had among her
pupils Thompson Walker, her stepfather,
William Thornton, and William Davis, all
now able and eloquent exhorters. She
was afterward of great service to others,
who are now efficient exhorters and members
of the church. Up to the time of the
burning of Hampton, she was engaged in
instructing children and adults, through
her shrewdness and the divine protection
eluding the vigilance of conservators of
the slave law, or, if temporarily interfered
with, again commencing and prosecuting
her labors of love with cautious fearlessness,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
and this in the midst of the infirmities
attending a feeble constitution.</p>

<p>In 1851, Mary was married to Thomas
Peake, formerly a slave, but afterward a
free man, light colored, intelligent, pious,
and in every respect a congenial companion,
with whom she lived happily till
her decease.</p>

<p>The bereaved husband bears affectionate
testimony to the strong mind and sound
judgment which dwelt in that feeble frame.
He loves to speak of his indebtedness to
her richly stored mind for much of his
knowledge of the Bible. At his request,
she would sit for hours and relate Bible
history. Others of our leading brethren
also gratefully acknowledge that they have
drawn largely from the same storehouse of
biblical and varied knowledge.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<div class="content"><p>Commencement of the Mission at Fortress Monroe.&mdash;Flight
of the Rebels from Hampton.&mdash;Burning of the
Town.&mdash;The Place reoccupied by Freedmen.</p></div>


<p>About the first of September, 1861, the
writer commenced the mission at Fortress
Monroe, under the auspices of the American
Missionary Association, and was quartered
in a building called the <i>Seminary</i>.
Three months before this, the Union troops
entered Hampton from Old Point. The
exciting scenes connected with this event
have been narrated to me by eye-witnesses.
Among these troops were Duryea's Zouaves,
called by the people "red men,"
from the color of their dress.</p>

<p>The utmost consternation seized the
inhabitants of Hampton, when they found
the Union troops were approaching. Many<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
of the colored people even were in a state
of suspense. All kinds of stories had been
told in regard to what the Yankees would
do with them. Yet hope predominated
over fear. They could hardly believe that
the Yankees meant them any harm. But
unmitigated fear filled the breasts of the
secessionists. There had been loud boasts
of what they would do; but when the red
trowsers approached, their bravery all ran
down into their nimble feet. The battery
of several large guns which they had
planted, and which might have done great
mischief to the Union troops, had they
been bravely manned, was drawn off. In
their confusion, the bridge was first fired,
and then the fire extinguished. Men,
women, and children ran screaming in
every direction, crying, "They come! they
come! What shall we do?"</p>

<p>Here is a man within doors, gun in
hand, pacing the floor in consternation,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
ever and anon rushing to the window,
and casting a frightened glance in the
direction of the road from the fort, till he
espies the Turk-like looking forms, moving
"double quick," when he darts from the
house, screaming, "They are coming! they
are coming!" Off he flies, with the fleetness
of fear, and in a few moments is seen
no more.</p>

<p>But in one house there are <i>two</i> individuals,
fearless and calm: Mrs. Peake
and her little daughter Daisy sit alike unalarmed;
the one in child-like faith, the
other in child-like simplicity. Mrs. Walker,
Mrs. Peake's mother, is in a neighbor's
house. Some time previous, the lady of
the house, an intimate friend, having great
confidence in sister Walker's prayers, said
to her, "Sally, you must pray harder."</p>

<p>"Oh," said she, "I do pray as hard as
I can."</p>

<p>"How do you pray, Sally?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
"I pray that the Lord's will may be
done."</p>

<p>"You don't pray right, Sally," said one
of them; "you must pray for Jeff. Davis."</p>

<p>"Oh," said she, "I pray as well as I
can, and as hard as I can. I am praying
all the time."</p>

<p>"That's right," said the other; "pray
on, Sally&mdash;your prayer will surely be
heard. You can't pray any better prayer
than you do. Pray that the Lord's will
may be done: I am sure it is the Lord's
will that the Yankees should not come
here to disturb us; and I have faith to
believe they will not. Pray on, Sally;
pray as hard as you can."</p>

<p>"I will, ma'am."</p>

<p>Time passed on; and now, on that fearful
morning, just after the sun has peeped
above the horizon, lo, the Yankees! The
strong faith above expressed fails the possessor;
and she, who would scarcely have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
set foot on the ground for very delicacy,
and who would not have been seen riding
out, unless in a fine carriage, drawn by
fine horses, elegantly harnessed, is now
heard calling for any old horse or mule,
and any rickety wagon or cart, with rope
harness&mdash;any thing&mdash;any thing to take
her out of the reach of the Yankees!
Masters and mistresses are now turned
fugitives.</p>

<p>Here is one of many interviews between
masters and slaves.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, master?"</p>

<p>"Oh, the Yankees are coming!"</p>

<p>"Are they? are they? What shall I
do, master?" with affected tokens of
fear.</p>

<p>"Get out of the town as soon as you
can."</p>

<p>"Oh, master, I'm afraid to leave the
house. Oh, those Yankees! Do you think
they will hurt me?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
"Yes, they'll take you and sell you off
to Cuba. Perhaps they'll kill you."</p>

<p>"Will they, master?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I tell you; why don't you leave
the town, you rascal?"</p>

<p>"Oh, master, I don't know what to do.
You an't a-going to leave us for the
Yankees to catch; are you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I'm off, and you better be off
with yourself&mdash;if you don't I'll shoot
you."</p>

<p>"Oh, master, don't shoot me&mdash;don't
leave me!"</p>

<p>"There they come!"</p>

<p>"Where, master, where? where?"</p>

<p>"I can't stop&mdash;good by&mdash;you better
be off!"</p>

<p>But Tony laughs in his sleeve, and says,
with upturned eyes, "I'm not afraid of
the Yankees! Bless God, old master's
gone&mdash;hope he'll never come back any
more!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
The Zouaves, on "double quick," approach
nearer, and up rides one of the
secessionists, in hot haste.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, master? What's
the matter?" inquires an intelligent negro.</p>

<p>"Oh, matter enough, you villain. You
brought all this trouble on us. I am disappointed
in you; I thought you would
stick by us; but you desert your best
friends in extremity. You won't find
those Yankees what you expect."</p>

<p>"Oh, master, won't you stay and protect
us?"</p>

<p>"No; good by, you villain. I'm out
of town, and so you had better be, very
quick." And on he flies.</p>

<p>The Zouaves are now crossing the bridge,&mdash;now
they enter the town,&mdash;and as they
pass through street after street, with hats
off, they bow politely to the colored people,
who cheer them from doors and windows.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
Now every fear is dissipated. Colored
knees are bent, and colored lips praise the
Lord. The hope that had all along predominated
over fear is more than met,
and the town is full of gladness. The
tidings spread, and the place is soon
thronged with colored people from the
country around.</p>

<p>But how different with the white inhabitants!
Go with me to the Sinclair estate&mdash;a
mile or two north of the town. One
of the officers rides up to the house, and
says,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Do you own this place?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Well, deliver up all your horses."</p>

<p>Sam Simpson, the colored foreman, says,
"Boys, bring up the horses."</p>

<p>"Oh, sir, spare an old man!"</p>

<p>"Hurry out those horses!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Sam, stand by me! Oh, dear, I
shall die! Don't leave me! Don't leave
me!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
Poor old man! His ill-gotten riches are
taking wings; the day of retribution has
come upon him, and, in spite of a sense
of its justice, we can not withhold our
pity.</p>

<p>The colored people were soon set to
work in constructing the battery in Hampton,
under the superintendence of Mr.
Pierce, of the Massachusetts regiment,
since then superintendent of the Port
Royal cotton culture. They worked with
a will, so that he was obliged to suspend
labor during the heat of the day, lest they
should over-exert themselves. After a
month had elapsed, the battle of Big
Bethel was fought, and <i>not</i> won; and
soon after, the disastrous defeat and flight
of Bull Run occurred.</p>

<p>To re&euml;nforce the army of the Potomac
a large part of the troops at Fortress
Monroe were ordered away. General Butler,
concluding that he had not sufficient<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
force to hold Hampton, ordered it to be
evacuated. He gave a week's notice to
the colored people to leave, and find refuge
on the other side of the bridge. But
many of them delayed too long, and were
able to move but a part of their goods;
in consequence of which they suffered
serious loss.</p>

<p>Among these was Mr. Peake. He lost
a large part of his furniture, as well as
his two houses. The order of the rebel
General Magruder to fire the place was
a gross exhibition of vandalism, without
the justifiable plea of military necessity.
The incendiary work began on the west
side of the village, and spread toward the
wharves. Hemmed in by the conflagration
on one side, and our firing on the
opposite shore, many of the executers of
the order fell dead or wounded, and were
consumed by the voracious flames. Those
who witnessed it said it was an appalling
sight.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
The evacuation took place on the 7th
and the conflagration on the 8th of August.
I arrived about a month afterward,
and on visiting Hampton, in company with
the provost marshal, Captain Burleigh, I
found only about half a dozen houses that
had escaped. One large house had had
its floor fired, but the fire had mysteriously
gone out, without doing much damage.
A large new building, a little out of town,
was also standing uninjured. But the
most of the village was a charred ruin;
the unsightly chimneys, and a few more
or less dilapidated walls, surviving to tell
the story of what had been.</p>

<p>Thus the place remained in abandoned
isolation during the winter. But with the
beginning of spring, the progress of our
arms opened Hampton to reoccupation.
It was thought proper that those who,
during the winter, had been confined in
large houses, overcrowded, should at once<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
build up the ruins, and provide themselves
homes. To this end, application was
made for an appropriation of government
lumber for past services. Some lumber
was received in this way, and the evacuation
of the camps by the soldiers, who
had winter quarters here, furnished still
more.</p>

<p>Quite a large number of neat cottages
have already been built. I encouraged
the people to build these small tenements
on lots belonging to the most decided
rebels, hoping that, if not claimed by
former owners, these homesteads would be
given to the occupants by government.
Thus Hampton is becoming quite a thriving,
free settlement, supported by fishing,
oystering, huckstering, artisanship, gardening,
and farming. Colored people have
settled on farms vacated by owners, and
will do well in keeping dairies, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
cultivating the land, and gathering its fruit,
if not molested.</p>

<p>The old court-house walls, that survived
the fire, have been inclosed for a
church and school house. The work was
done by colored mechanics. It seems fit
that this place, where injustice has been
sanctioned by law, should be converted
into a sanctuary of justice, righteousness,
and free education.</p>

<p>We consider that we are here trying
the very highest experiment with ex-slaves.
They are here emphatically "turned loose,"
and are shifting for themselves,&mdash;doing
their own head-work and hand-work. It
is not to be expected that on the "sacred
soil of Virginia" this experiment should
be carried out without encountering difficulties;
but we feel it to be a thing of
blessed interest to follow as Providence
leads, and do the work of faith and love,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
leaving the result with him. There is
inspiration in the reflection that we are
doing a representative work, and whatever
the issue, the work will not be burned up,
nor the workers permitted to suffer essential
loss. We know that our labor is not
in vain in the Lord.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<div class="content"><p>Opening of Religious Services and Schools.&mdash;Mrs. Peake a
Teacher.&mdash;Singing in the Schools.&mdash;Christmas Festival.</p></div>


<p>The religious and educational part of
the mission has been one of blessedness
and promise. And in this, as in everything
else, I have aimed to teach self-development.
In connection with the gathering of the
people in religious meetings,
I proposed to commence Sabbath and
week-day schools, with such teachers as I
had at hand. Meanwhile, some of the children
of the vicinity, getting perhaps some
hint of my intention, or prompted by an
impulse from on high, called on Mrs. Peake,
and requested her to teach them, as she
had taught the children in Hampton.</p>

<p>It was with much gratification that I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
learned this request. I soon found from
observation, as well as information, that we
had in her a teacher of the choicest spirit,
and of peculiar qualifications. She was
happy in having pupils as ready to learn
as to request instruction. Her school
numbered at first only about half a dozen,
but in a few days she had between fifty
and sixty. These scholars were found to
have generally very fair intellectual capabilities,
and a few evinced quite rare talents.
Among these was her own little
daughter, five years old, named Hattie, but
familiarly called by the pet name of Daisy.
She learned to read simple lessons fluently
in a very short time. Others also exhibited
a precocity which from day to day rewarded
and stimulated the ardor of this
devoted teacher.</p>

<p>Mrs. Peake was not satisfied with the
ordinary routine of the week-day school
room, but felt that the teacher of a mission<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
school should aim to educate the children
for eternity as well as for time. She found
great assistance in the primer, catechism,
and other elementary religious books, with
which she had been furnished. She felt
that the teachings of the week-day school
ought to be largely preparatory to the rehearsals
of the Sabbath school. What an
impression for good would be made upon
the rising generation, were this course universally
pursued!</p>

<p>Mrs. Peake deeply realized that every
undertaking, and especially that of training
the young, should be begun and continued
with prayer. She not only prayed
with her pupils, but taught them to pray.
Having a rich store of scriptural knowledge,
and feeling its worth, and the importance
of simplifying it to the young, in
order to awaken their interest, she bestowed
special attention on catechetical
instruction. Not satisfied with having<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
Scripture truths committed to memory,
she explained and inculcated them, with
line upon line and precept upon precept,
drawn from her own knowledge and experience.
I can not think that this spiritual
instruction interfered in the least with the
other, but rather was a handmaid to it,
furnishing a pleasant as well as profitable
variety, awakening and developing heart
and mind at once.</p>

<p>Mrs. Peake also considered singing an
important part of a right education.
Among the favorite hymns first learned
and sung in her school were, "I want to
be an angel," "There is a happy land,"
"Around the throne of God in heaven,"
"Here we meet to part again," "In heaven
we part no more," and others of kindred
spirit, so familiar in the Sabbath schools at
the North. How ardent was her desire to
win the young intellect and affections for
Jesus and heaven! With strict appropriateness<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
may we apply to her the poet's
language,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"And as a bird each fond endearment tries,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To tempt its new-fledged offspring to the skies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She tried each art, reproved each dull delay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Allured to brighter worlds, and led the way."<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>While Mrs. Peake attached prime importance
to the training of the rising generation,
she felt that great improvement might
be made among the adults. This view
inspired her action from the first in Hampton,
and with a blessed result, that is now
apparent to all. She was accordingly very
ready to gratify the desire of a number of
adults for an evening school, notwithstanding
her increasing infirmities. The result
is, that several, who scarcely knew the alphabet
before, now begin to read with considerable
readiness.</p>

<p>In these multiplied labors, she exhibited
a martyr spirit, of the true type. Often
when she was confined to her bed, her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
pupils would be found around her, drawing
knowledge as it were from her very
life. Again and again did Dr. Browne,
brigade surgeon, who concerned himself
for her like a brother, advise her to consider
her weakness, and intermit her exhausting
duties. The scene of these labors
was the Brown Cottage, near the seminary,
fronting on Hampton Roads. The school
room was the front room, first story. Her
own family apartment was the front room,
second story. It will ever be a place about
which precious memories will linger.</p>

<p>It was proposed that, on Christmas day,
the children of the school should have a
festival. All the week previous, they were
busy, with their teacher, in preparations
and rehearsals. A large room on the first
floor of the seminary was decorated with
evergreens for the occasion, and at one end
a platform was constructed. At an early
hour in the evening, the room was crowded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
with colored children and adults, and soldiers
and officers. The programme opened
with the singing of "My country, 'tis of
thee." Chaplain Fuller read the account
of the nativity of Christ. Dr. Linson
prayed. Then the children discoursed
very sweet music in solo, semi-chorus, and
chorus, and at intervals spoke pieces in a
very commendable manner, considering
that it was probably the first attempt of
colored children in the South.</p>

<p>Little Daisy, (Mrs. Peake's only child,)
about five years old, was the acknowledged
star of the evening. She sang very prettily
in solo, and also in connection with the
chorus. She sang alone the whole of the
hymn, "I want to be an angel."</p>

<img src="images/mptct_03.jpg" width="419" height="540"
alt="Portrait of Mary&#39;s daughter, Daisy"
title="Little Daisy" />
</div>

<p>I spoke of the contrast between the present
and the past. A year ago, <i>white</i> children
in Hampton could enjoy a scene of
this kind, but <i>colored</i> children were excluded.
But now times have changed.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>The white man's child is away, and the
colored man's child is on the stage, and
swells the choral song. And this is but a
miniature picture of what will be. The
present is prophetic of the future. The
few hundred children about Fortress Monroe,
now gathered into schools, after the
pattern of this first school, are types of one
million of children throughout the sunny
South, on whom the sunlight of knowledge
is yet to shine.</p>

<p>After the concert exercises, the members
of the school and others repaired to the
Brown Cottage. Here we were conducted
into the school room, which, like the concert
room, was tastefully decorated with
evergreens; and we filed around a long
table laden with refreshments, and surrounded
with Christmas trees, loaded with
good things, all gotten up spontaneously
by, and at the expense of, the colored
people in the neighborhood. The viands<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
were partaken of with a relish, and by
unanimous consent it was declared a merry
Christmas of the right type; the children
sang, "Merry Christmas to all! Merry
Christmas! Merry Christmas to all!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<div class="content"><p>Failing of Health.&mdash;Religious Joy.&mdash;Farewell
Messages.&mdash;Death.&mdash;Funeral.&mdash;Conclusion.</p></div>


<p>After the exciting scenes of the Christmas
festival, Mrs. Peake's health sensibly
declined, and in a week or two she was
obliged to suspend, and soon to give up
entirely, the charge to which she had
clung with such tenacity. I visited her
frequently, and was the bearer of clothing
and other tokens from friends at the North.
Every thing in our power was done to
cheer her, and never were ministerings
more cordially bestowed, or more gratefully
received and richly repaid. To visit
her had always been a privilege, but the
privilege was doubly precious during her
last illness. To see how a frail woman,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
with an exquisitely nervous temperament,
could deliberately and calmly bid farewell
to family, pupils, and friends, and yield
herself into her Father's hands, to pass
through the ordeal of sickness and death,
was a privilege and a blessing.</p>

<p>In her presence I was a learner, and,
under the inspiration of her words and
example, obtained new strength for fresh
endeavors in the cause of God and humanity.
In one of my visits, she told me that
I must give her love to the committee in
New York, and all the friends of the mission;
that she had had a bright vision of
her Saviour, and he had assured her that
the cause would triumph; that we were
sowing seed which would spring up and
become a tree, to overspread the whole
earth; that we should be a great blessing
to this down-trodden people, and they
would fulfill a glorious destiny. "Oh,
yes," said she, "brother Lockwood, you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
will succeed, for Jesus has told me so this
morning."</p>

<p>For two weeks previous to her death, she
seemed to be in the "land of Beulah," on
the "mountains of the shepherds," where,
like Bunyan's pilgrim, she could clearly
descry the promised land. She had a
strong desire to depart and be with Christ,
which was far better than even his most
intimate earthly visits. Again and again,
as I called to see her, she assured me that
she had had a fresh visit from her Saviour,
and he had told her that where he was she
should be, and she would be like him when
she should see him as he is. She knew
not where in the universe heaven might
be, but where her Saviour was, there would
be her heaven, for she would be with
him.</p>

<p>Her constantly increasing cough and
expectoration, though not attended with
much pain, were, as usual, accompanied<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
with uneasiness, want of sleep, and great
weakness, which made her frequently request
prayer that she might have patience
to bear all without a murmur, and await
her Father's will. She wanted to say, with
the feelings of Job, "All the days of my
appointed time will I wait, till my change
come. I know that my Redeemer liveth."</p>

<p>At one time, her symptoms seemed more
favorable, and I expressed a hope of her
recovery. "No," said she; "I have taken
leave of my family, and of every thing on
earth, and I would rather go, if it be God's
will; only I want to wait patiently till he
comes to call me." Her husband and
mother told me that, during the previous
night, she had bidden them all farewell,
and left farewell messages for her school,
and the church, and all her friends. She
had thus set her house in order, to die, or,
rather, to live a diviner life, and she was
waiting the summons home. She said that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
she felt like a little child in her Father's
arms; and if, by lifting a pebble, she could
hold back her spirit, she would not do it.</p>

<p>Several days before her death, she requested
me to sing "The Christian's Home
in Glory," or "Rest for the Weary"&mdash;a
hymn, with its tune, dear to her for itself and
for its associations. As I repeated the chorus,
she exclaimed, again and again, with
great tenderness and emphasis, "Rest, rest,
rest! Oh, brother Lockwood, there I shall
rest, rest, rest! This weary head shall
rest on my Saviour's bosom."</p>

<p>When I had sung the last stanza,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Sing, oh, sing, ye heirs of glory,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Shout your triumph as you go,"&mdash;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>she burst out in an ecstasy that seemed as
if the spirit would break away from the
body, "Oh, brother, I shall sing! I shall
shout! Won't we sing? Won't we shout?
Yes, we shall&mdash;we shall sing and shout!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
On Saturday morning, February 22, she
was in a very happy frame of mind, and
said that she had had precious visits from
her Saviour; he had told her that he was
coming soon, and would fulfill her heart's
desire in taking her to him. Her mother
said, that during the previous night she
had been constantly reaching up, and
sometimes she would cry out, with great
earnestness, "Do not leave me, dear Jesus."</p>

<p>She requested me to sing for her, and I
sung, "The Shining Shore," and "Homeward
Bound." During the singing of the
last stanza of the latter song, she was filled
with joy.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Into the harbor of heaven now we glide,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">We're home at last!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Softly we drift o'er its bright silver tide,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">We're home at last!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Glory to God! All our dangers are o'er;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We stand secure on the glorified shore;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Glory to God! we will shout evermore,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">We're home at last!"<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
"Yes," she exclaimed, "home at last!
Glory to God! Home at last! Oh, I
shall soon be home&mdash;home&mdash;home at
last!"</p>

<p>On the night of that day, about twelve
o'clock, her waiting, longing spirit went
home. Washington's birthday was her
birthday to a higher life. After many a
sleepless night, this last evening she was
permitted to rest quietly, till the midnight
cry struck upon her ear, "Behold, the
bridegroom cometh!" It found her ready,
with her lamp trimmed and burning.
Calling for her mother, she threw herself
into her embrace, as her spirit did into the
embrace of her Saviour.</p>

<p>Just at midnight, on all the ships in
Hampton Roads,&mdash;and which are so near
us that the cry on shipboard is distinctly
heard on shore,&mdash;the watchman cried
aloud, as usual, "Twelve o'clock, and all's
well!" The sound penetrated the sick<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
chamber, and the dying invalid apparently
heard it. She smiled sweetly, and then
breathed her last sigh, and entered upon
that rest which remains for the people
of God.</p>

<p>The next morning, which was the Sabbath,
I called, and found her husband and
mother bearing up under their bereavement
with Christian fortitude. They
could smile through their tears; though
they wept, it was not as those who have no
hope. In the services of the day, the bereaved
were remembered in fervent, sympathizing
prayer. We all felt sorely afflicted,
and would have grieved, but for the
thought that our temporary loss was her
eternal gain. In the evening, a prayer
meeting was held till midnight in the room
where her body lay; but all felt like saying,
She is not here; her spirit is with
her Father and our Father, her God and
our God.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
On Monday, at eleven o'clock, a large
concourse assembled at her funeral. We
met in her school room, at the Brown Cottage,
a place sweetened and hallowed by
associations with her crowning labors, and
thus a fit place for these leave-taking services.
The occasion was one of mingled
sorrow and joy. The services were begun
by singing, according to her request, the
familiar hymn,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I would not live alway,"&mdash;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>to the tune of "Sweet Home," in which
it is generally sung by the people here,
with the chorus,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Home! Home! Sweet, sweet home!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There's no place like heaven, there's no place like home!"<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>The impression was very thrilling.
Chaplain Fuller, of the sixteenth Massachusetts
regiment, offered prayer&mdash;praying
fervently for the bereaved mother and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
husband, and for little Daisy, who would
one day realize more than now a mother's
worth by her loss. We then sung, according
to her request, her favorite hymn,
"The Christian's Home in Glory," or
"Rest for the Weary." I selected for my
text Hebrews 4:9&mdash;"There remaineth
therefore a rest to the people of God." At
the conclusion of the sermon the children
sang,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Here we suffer grief and pain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here we meet to part again;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In heaven we part no more.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Oh, that will be joyful,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Joyful, joyful, joyful,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Oh, that will be joyful,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When we meet to part no more.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Little children</i> will be there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who have sought the Lord by prayer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From every Sabbath school.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Oh, that will be joyful, &amp;c.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Teachers</i>, too, shall meet above,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And our <i>pastors</i>, whom we love,<br /></span>

</div>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
The coffin was then opened, and we
took the last, lingering look at a face
whose heavenly lineaments I can never
forget.</p>

<p>In long procession, in which her recent
charge bore a prominent part, we accompanied
her to her resting place. The place
of her sepulture is about a hundred yards
north of the seminary, on the bank of
the inlet. A live-oak tree stands at her
head, projecting its emblematic evergreen
foliage over the sod-roofed tenement.</p>

<p>The departed selected, as a remembrance
of her immortality, the 17th verse of the
118th Psalm, "I shall not die, but live."
The thirty-nine years of her earthly existence
were but the prelude to a life beyond
the sky; and while her spirit survives the
ravages of death, her name shall live in

be untold riches laid up in heaven. And
who will sustain those who bear the burden

prayer? This is a work thrice blessed to
all concerned.</p>

<h2>APPENDIX.</h2>

<h3>MISSION TO THE FREEDMEN.</h3>


<p>On the 8th of August, 1861, a letter was
addressed to Major-General Butler, then in
command at Fortress Monroe, Virginia, by
the treasurer of the American Missionary Association,
respecting the people whom he had
denominated "contrabands." In this letter,
the writer communicated to General Butler
the wishes of some persons in the free states,
that, as considerable embarrassment was felt
by the public authorities with regard to the
increasing numbers of colored persons who
had fled and were fleeing for protection to the
forts and camps of the United States, they
should be sent into the free states to obtain
employment. A prompt and courteous reply
was received, and, in reference to the desire expressed,
General Butler stated that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
"contrabands" would be protected; that many of
them would be employed in government service;
that there was land enough to cultivate
in Virginia; and as the freedmen would
never be suffered to return into bondage,
there was no necessity for sending any of
them to the Northern States.</p>

<p>The executive committee of the association,
feeling highly encouraged by these assurances,
at once determined to commence a mission at
Fortress Monroe. Rev. Lewis C. Lockwood
was commissioned as their first missionary to
the freedmen. He repaired to Washington,
where he received encouragement from the
government, and recommendation to the commanding
general, Wool, who had succeeded
General Butler. General Wool received him
cordially, heartily approved the plan, and afforded
him all needful facilities.</p>

<p>Mr. Lockwood conferred with the leading
persons among the freedmen, investigated
the condition and wants of the people, made
arrangements for week-day and Sabbath meetings,
organized week-day and evening schools,
employed several of the most intelligent and
gifted colored people as assistants, and through
the committee in New York made urgent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
appeals for clothing, &amp;c., for the destitute, and
also for additional missionaries and teachers.</p>

<p>The late lamented Mrs. Mary S. Peake was
the first teacher employed. She continued to
teach as long as her health permitted, and
near to the time of her decease. Other teachers
have been employed; chaplains in the
army and pious soldiers have proffered their
occasional services, and the religious meetings,
Sabbath schools, and week-day schools, have
been well attended. Mr. Lockwood labored
there thirteen months, and then removed to
another field. In his final report, he states
that he had ministered to a congregation at
Hampton, where the average attendance was
four hundred; and to a congregation at Fortress
Monroe, where the average attendance
was about the same.</p>

<p>A day school was kept in a house, near
Hampton, formerly the residence of Ex-President
Tyler, which was wholly given up for
the use of the freedmen. This school was subsequently
removed to the old Court House at
Hampton, which had been fitted up for the
purpose, government furnishing a portion of
the lumber. This school became the largest
under the care of the freedmen's teachers,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
and numbered at one time five hundred scholars.
Among the ruins of Hampton, which
had, at an early period of the rebellion, been
burned by the rebels, the colored people erected
rude cottages, the materials being gathered
from the vacated camps, the deserted dwellings
of fugitive slaveholders, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Such of the freedmen as were not employed
by government have obtained a
living by fishing, oystering, huckstering,
carting, washing, &amp;c.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Interesting Facts.</span></h3>

<p>Many highly interesting facts have been
communicated with regard to the freedmen&mdash;their
natural endowments, their facility in acquiring
knowledge in letters and arms, their
industrial habits, their shrewdness in business
transactions, their gratitude, their courage,
their acquaintance with passing events, their
confidence that the result of the rebellion
will be the liberation of their people, and
their piety. Some of these facts have been
extensively published, and have been read
with high gratification. It is thought that
a few of these facts may add to the value
of this little publication.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Schools for the Children.</span></h3>

<p>A young teacher at Hampton, Virginia,
writes as follows: "When I first commenced
the school here, I found the children such
as slavery makes&mdash;quarrelsome, thievish, uncleanly
in their persons and attire, and seemingly
inclined to almost every species of
wickedness; and it appeared to me that they
were too far gone to be ever raised to any
thing like intelligent children at the North.
But I found that I had reckoned without my
host in the persons of these children.</p>

<p>"At the end of the first week there was a
decided improvement manifested, and in four
weeks you hardly ever saw one hundred and
fifty children more cleanly in their persons
and apparel. Their lessons were, in most
cases, quickly and correctly learned, and their
behavior was kind and affectionate toward
each other, while in singing the sweet little
Sabbath school songs, I should not hesitate
to put them side by side with the best of our
Sabbath-school scholars at the North. And
they so fully appreciate my humble efforts in
their behalf, that my table in the school room
is loaded, morning and noon, with oranges,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
lemons, apples, figs, candies, and other sweet
things too numerous to mention, all testifying
their love to me, although I can do so little
for them."</p>

<p>Another teacher, at Beaufort, South Carolina,
writes: "My school numbered about
forty of the children. Most of them were
very dirty and poorly dressed, all very black
in color. A happier group of children I never
expect to witness than those who composed
my school: bright eyes, happy looks, kind and
patient dispositions, made them look attractive
to my eyes, though they were 'horribly black,'
as some have called them, and very dirty at
first. But they were so innocent, so despised
by others, and withal so anxious to learn, that
I felt a true sympathy for them.</p>

<p>"Their masters have kept them in darkness
and degradation. This is only the result
of slavery.</p>

<p>"They are very eager to learn. Every one
wishes to be taught first; yet, unlike some
white children, they are patient and willing
to wait. They do not easily tire of study,
but are very diligent in getting their lessons.
I have known them to teach each other, or
sit alone and drill over a lesson for two hours
at a time.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
"Let me relate to you a little incident that
will illustrate what I have just said. One
day, at Beaufort, soon after we landed, while
walking through the upper portion of the
town, I heard a little voice saying the alphabet,
while another wee voice, scarcely audible,
was repeating it after the first. I looked
quickly around to discover from whence the
voice came; and what do you think I saw?
Why, seated on the piazza of a large empty
house were two of the blackest little negro
children, one about seven, the other not more
than three years old. The elder had his arm
thrown lovingly around the almost naked
form of the other, and with an open primer
in the lap of one, they were at their study.
An hour after, I returned by the same spot,
and was both pleased and surprised to find
them still at it. God bless the little ones!</p>

<p>"This desire, or rather eagerness, to learn
to read, is manifested by all. I have stopped
by the wayside many a time, and have immediately
collected a group of old and young
about me, and have made them repeat the
alphabet after me slowly, letter by letter.
They esteem it the greatest kindness I can
show them, and as I turn to depart, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
fervent 'God bless you, massa,' 'Tank de Lord,
massa,' reach my ears."</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Morals of the Freedmen.</span></h3>

<p>After the mission had been established, one
of the officers' wives remarked to another, "I
do not miss my things nowadays."</p>

<p>Nearly all the church members had taken
the temperance pledge.</p>

<p>"They have their vices," writes a northern
physician on one of the plantations on Port
Royal Island; "deception and petty thieving
prevail. They are careless, indolent, and improvident.
They have a miserable habit of
scolding and using authoritative language to
one another. All these vices are clearly the
result of <i>slave education</i>, and will gradually
disappear under improved conditions....
If one is honest with them, and gets their confidence,
the rest is easily accomplished."</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Marriage.</span></h3>

<p>A very large portion, probably, at least,
more than half of the "married" freed people,
had been married only in slave fashion, by
"taking up together," or living together by
mutual agreement, without any marriage<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
ceremony. The missionary proposed to such that
they should be married agreeably to the usages
in the free states. The leaders of the colored
people were conversed with, and they, without
exception, agreed as to the propriety of the
measure. One, now advanced in life, said,
that when he proposed to his companion to
go to a minister and be lawfully married, she
replied, "Oh, what use will it be? Master can
separate us to-morrow." But he coincided
fully in the propriety of the proposed course.</p>

<p>Mr. Lockwood, after preaching on the sanctity
of the marriage relation, proceeded to
unite in wedlock several couples, among
whom were some who had lived together
for years. He gave each of the parties a certificate,
in handsome form, which they seemed
to prize very highly. It appeared to have a
most beneficial effect upon the parties themselves,
and the whole population.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Native Eloquence.</span></h3>

<p>Not a few of the freedmen, though illiterate,
exhibit remarkable powers of eloquence.
The missionary, in describing the
address of one of them, after a discourse by
the former, says, "The address was a masterpiece.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
It melted every heart. He appealed
to the soldiers present who were in rebellion
against God, striving to put down rebellion
in this land, and asked them how they, who
had been taught to read the Bible, and had
learned the Lord's Prayer in infancy from a
mother's lips, could stand in judgment, when
a poor, despised, and inferior race, who,
though denied the Bible, had been taught of
God, and found their way to Christ, should
rise up and condemn them. He then turned
to his fellow 'contrabands,' and entreated
them to embrace thankfully, and improve, the
boon already given. He considered the present
a pledge of the future&mdash;the virtual emancipation
of fifteen or eighteen hundred the
promise of the emancipation of four millions.
The Lord works from little to great."</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Church Meeting.</span></h3>

<p>The missionary wrote: "Last Thursday I
had an opportunity to observe the intellectual
state of a considerable number of the brethren
at a church meeting. I was surprised at
their understanding and wisdom in regard to
church order and propriety, and tone of discipline.
As the church records had been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
burned up in the church edifice at Hampton, I
inquired how far any of them could recall
their contents. One or two replied that they
could almost repeat the church regulations
from memory.</p>

<p>"In the discussion, high ground was taken
in regard to the Sabbath, the temperance
cause, and other matters of Christian morality.
In discipline, stress was laid on the propriety
and duty of private admonition, in its successive
scriptural steps, before public censure.
On this point one brother said he had privately
admonished a neighbor of the impropriety
of taking articles to the camp on the
Sabbath, and he had acknowledged his fault,
and promised amendment. The duty of forgiving
offenders, and undoing wrongs, was
also insisted on. Several had been improperly
excluded from church privileges through the
influence of white power. It was, therefore,
decided to-day that those who had the confidence
of the church should be restored to
church-fellowship unconditionally."</p>

<p>One of the members, and an aged leader,
stated that he had on one occasion been
seized by a white deacon, dragged down from
the gallery, and threatened with thirty-nine<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
lashes, because there was a little of the Methodist
in his composition, and he had "got
happy and shouted in meeting."</p>

<p>On another occasion, William Davis concluded
some remarks as follows: "I hope that
all of you, old and young, will learn to read,
as I did. When I was converted, I was
anxious to learn to read God's book. I
kneeled down by my book, [he here kneeled
by the table,] and prayed that God would
teach me to read it&mdash;if only a little, I would
be thankful. And I learned, and you can if
you will, for you have no one to hinder you,
as I had. We should all show that we are
worthy of freedom. Only educate us, and
we will show ourselves capable of knowledge.
Some say we have not the same faculties and
feelings with white folks.... All we
want is cultivation. What would the best
soil produce without cultivation? We want
to get wisdom. That is all we need. Let us
get that, and we are made for time and eternity."</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
